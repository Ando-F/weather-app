# weather-app
This is my attempt to create a weather app. The goal of the project was to understand how API works. 

That I sussesfully accomplished. Of course, the project lack of design and tons of features, but at some point I got really bored working on it. It just seemed like I got something I had to understand, so there was no need to keep on trying to polish things up.
